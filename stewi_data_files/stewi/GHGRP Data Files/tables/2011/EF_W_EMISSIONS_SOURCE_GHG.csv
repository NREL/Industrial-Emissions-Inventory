Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.BAMM chosen (i.e. alternative method).Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes.Planned actions to comply with Subpart W.Documenting volume between isolation valves, temperature at actual conditions, and absolute pressure at actual conditions will be initiated but will not be available for 2012.  In addition, rule revisions and interpretations will be tracked, as it is expected that additional discussions on blowdown vent reporting will occur in 2012 and rule revisions or clarifications "

Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods:1. Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of this subpart,2. Supplier data,3. Engineering calculations, or4. Other company records.PSE&G has opted to use the “Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of this subpart”, as codified in 40 CFR 98.234(f)(1)(i).Prior to the finalization of Subpart W, PSE&G monitored leaks from equipment using lower explosive limit (“LEL”) detectors throughout the plant.  With the finalization and implementation of Subpart W, PSE&G has continued to monitor the plant with the LEL detectors.  PSE&G established an alarm for any reading above at 20% or greater of the LEL of methane, equivalent to 10,000 parts per million.  Pursuant to 40 CFR 98.234(a)(3), only emissions detected of 10,000 ppm or greater are considered to be leaks.  Therefore, any component leaks at the LNG plant would trigger an alarm.  If an alarm were triggered, the leaking component would be identified using a Leak-Tec bubble solution to isolate the component leaking.  By PSE&G policy, any component found to be leaking is repaired, with a log of the date and type of component repaired.  No alarms occurred at the Burlington LNG plant in RY2011."

The operating mode measured is assumed to be the mode that the compressor operated in during the majority of the 2011 reporting year.No information was collected on whether the blowdown vents are manifolded to rod packing vents.  Based on other company records that indicate the majority of blowdown vents are not manifolded to rod packing vents, it is assumed the vents are not manifolded together."

Connectors are included in the valve component classification in the current LDAR survey reports, therefore leaking valves and leaking connectors are both identified as leaking valves in the reports.  To be conservative, the valve emission factors included in Subpart W were used to calculate emissions from any component identified as a leaking valve on the LDAR reports.  No leaking pressure relief valves were identified during the LDAR surveys.  Meters were not included as part of the existing facility LDAR monitoring program, and for the purposes of this report were assumed not to be leaking."

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.BAMM chosen (i.e. alternative method).Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes.Planned actions to comply with Subpart W.Documenting volume between isolation valves, temperature at actual conditions, and absolute pressure at actual conditions will be initiated but will not be available for 2012.  In addition, rule revisions and interpretations will be tracked, as it is expected that additional discussions on blowdown vent reporting will occur in 2012 and rule revisions or clarifications "

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.BAMM chosen (i.e. alternative method).Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes.Planned actions to comply with Subpart W.Documenting volume between isolation valves, temperature at actual conditions, and absolute pressure at actual conditions will be initiated but will not be available for 2012.

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.BAMM chosen (i.e. alternative method).Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes.Planned actions to comply with Subpart W.Documenting volume between isolation valves, temperature at actual conditions, and absolute pressure at actual conditions will be initiated but will not be available for 2012.  In addition, rule revisions and interpretations will be tracked, as it is expected that additional discussions on blowdown vent reporting will occur in 2012 and rule revisions or clarifications "

Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods:1. Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of this subpart,2. Supplier data,3. Engineering calculations, or4. Other company records.EcoEléctrica has opted to use the “Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of this subpart”, as codified in 40 CFR 98.234(f)(1)(i).Prior to the finalization of Subpart W, EcoEléctrica monitored leaks from equipment using lower explosive limit (“LEL”) detectors throughout the plant.  With the finalization and implementation of Subpart W, EcoEléctrica has continued to monitor the plant with the LEL detectors.  EcoEléctrica established an alarm for any reading above at 20% or greater of the LEL of methane, equivalent to 10,000 parts per million.  Pursuant to 40 CFR 98.234(a)(3), only emissions detected of 10,000 ppm or greater are considered to be leaks.  Therefore, any component leaks at the LNG plant would trigger an alarm.  If an alarm were triggered, EcoEléctrica would immediately send personnel to the alarm to investigate the cause of the alarm.  As a part of the investigation, EcoEléctrica would investigate the equipment surrounding the alarm for leaks as well as any sources for false alarm.  While investigating leaks, equipment leaks may be identified using a Leak-Tec bubble solution to isolate the component leaking and/or engineering estimates.  By EcoEléctrica policy, any component found to be leaking is repaired, with a l"

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.BAMM chosen (i.e. alternative method).Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes.Planned actions to comply with Subpart W.Documenting volume between isolation valves, temperature at actual conditions, and absolute pressure at actual conditions will be initiated but will not be available for 2012.  In addition, rule revisions and interpretations will be tracked, as it is expected that additional discussions on blowdown vent reporting will occur in 2012 and rule revisions or clarifications "

The emission rates are therefore based on the emission factors listed in Table 6-17. Natural Gas Transmission Compressor Station Component Emission Factors in the 2009 American Petroleum Institute Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry; this is based on engineering calculations.  The operating mode measured is assumed to be the mode that the compressor operated in during the majority of the 2011 reporting year.No information was collected on whether the rod packing vents, blowdown valve vents, or isolation valve vents are routed to a flare.  Based on other company records that indicate the majority of vents are routed directly to atmosphere, it is assumed these vents are also routed directly to atmosphere.  No information was collected on whether the blowdown vents are manifolded to rod packing vents.  Based on other company records that indicate the majority of blowdown vents are not manifolded to rod packing vents, it is assumed the vents are not manifolded together."

Connectors are included in the valve component classification in the current LDAR survey reports, therefore leaking valves and leaking connectors are both identified as leaking valves in the reports.  To be conservative, the valve emission factors included in Subpart W were used to calculate emissions from any component identified as a leaking valve on the LDAR reports.

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.BAMM chosen (i.e. alternative method).Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes.Planned actions to comply with Subpart W.Documenting volume between isolation valves, temperature at actual conditions, and absolute pressure at actual conditions will be initiated but will not be available for 2012.  In addition, rule revisions and interpretations will be tracked, as it is expected that additional discussions on blowdown vent reporting will occur in 2012 and rule revisions or clarifications "

The average molecular weight was determined by calculating the weighted average based on the composition data.  Specific to the brine process, ONEOK NGL completed sampling at Hutchinson in order to calculate normal operation gas routed from the separator to the flare.  The results were variable but all within a fairly negligible range (ppb to very low ppm).  Any small amounts that may accumulate in the separator and produce enough pressure over time to occasionally open to the degassifier are considered negligible and are likely captured in the conservative flare totals.  The research is also aplicable to Bushton."

The LDAR information collected from Mont Belvieu included total component counts and an emission factor scaled by a leaking fraction of components.  To detemine the number of leaking components the total componets was multiplied by one minus the non-leaking contol percentage and then rounded to the next whole number.  The leaking component number was then scaled based on the throughput of Mont Belvieu (160,000 bbl/day) and Bushton (140,000 bbl/day) and then rounded to the next whole number."

The emission rates are therefore based on the emission factors listed in Table 6-17. Natural Gas Transmission Compressor Station Component Emission Factors in the 2009 American Petroleum Institute Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry; this is based on engineering calculations.  The operating mode measured is assumed to be the mode that the compressor operated in during the majority of the 2011 reporting year.No information was collected on whether the rod packing vents, blowdown valve vents, or isolation valve vents are routed to a flare.  Based on other company records that indicate the majority of vents are routed directly to atmosphere, it is assumed these vents are also routed directly to atmosphere.  No information was collected on whether the blowdown vents are manifolded to rod packing vents.  Based on other company records that indicate the majority of blowdown vents are not manifolded to rod packing vents, it is assumed the vents are not manifolded together."

This estimate was later used in estimating the emission factor calculated using Equation W-32.     (2) Meter/Regulator run count value used in Eq. W-32 was based on the number of meters and regulators at the three NG compressor stations.

Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods:1. Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of this subpart,2. Supplier data,3. Engineering calculations, or4. Other company records.PSE&G has opted to use the “Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of this subpart”, as codified in 40 CFR 98.234(f)(1)(i).Prior to the finalization of Subpart W, PSE&G personnel visited each above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations (T-D station) monthly.  With the finalization and implementation of Subpart W, PSE&G has continued to visit each T-D station monthly.  During each visit, the site was monitored for leaks by visual inspection and smell.  If necessary, the leaking component was identified using a Leak-Tec bubble solution to isolate the component leaking.  By PSE&G policy, any component found to be leaking is repaired, with a log of the date and type of component repaired.  The CH4 and CO2 emissions from T-D stations were estimated using the corresponding emission factor in Table W-7 in equation W-30B.  PSE&G assumed that each identified component leaked for 8760 hours in 2011."

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.BAMM chosen (i.e. alternative method).Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes.Planned actions to comply with Subpart W.Documenting volume between isolation valves, temperature at actual conditions, and absolute pressure at actual conditions will be initiated but will not be available for 2012.

In 2011, it was not in company policy to measure emissions from vents. Existing information found in company records will be used to estimate the amount of time the compressors were in each operating mode. The assumed emission rates for each operating mode has been derived from ""Natural Gas Industry Methane Emission Factor Improvement Study Draft Final Report. (Harrison et al.) Specifically, emission factors estimated in the report for the gathering and boosting station has been applied. In addition, gas compositions have been estimated from company records under BAMM and may not refelct the level of QA/QC required in the rule language.

Natural Gas Transmission Compressor Station Component Emission Factors in the 2009 American Petroleum Institute Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry; this is based on engineering calculations.  The operating mode measured is assumed to be the mode that the compressor operated in during the majority of the 2011 reporting year.No information was collected on whether the blowdown vents are manifolded to rod packing vents.  Based on other company records that indicate the majority of blowdown vents are not manifolded to rod packing vents, it is assumed the vents are not manifolded together."

Best available monitoring methods means any of the following methods:1. Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of this subpart,2. Supplier data,3. Engineering calculations, or4. Other company records.SCG has opted to use the “Monitoring methods currently used by the facility that do not meet the specifications of this subpart”, as codified in 40 CFR 98.234(f)(1)(i).Prior to the finalization of Subpart W, SCG personnel visited each above grade transmission-distribution transfer stations (T-D station) monthly.  With the finalization and implementation of Subpart W, SCG has continued to visit each T-D station monthly.  During each visit, the site was monitored for leaks by visual inspection and smell.  If necessary, the leaking component was identified using a Leak-Tec bubble solution to isolate the component leaking.  By SCG policy, any component found to be leaking is repaired, with a log of the date and type of component repaired.  The CH4 and CO2 emissions from T-D stations were estimated using the corresponding emission factor in Table W-7 in equation W-30B.  SCG assumed that each identified component leaked for 8760 hours in 2011."

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.BAMM chosen (i.e. alternative method).Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes.Planned actions to comply with Subpart W.Documenting volume between isolation valves, temperature at actual conditions, and absolute pressure at actual conditions will be initiated but will not be available for 2012.

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.BAMM chosen (i.e. alternative method).Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes.Planned actions to comply with Subpart W.Documenting volume between isolation valves, temperature at actual conditions, and absolute pressure at actual conditions will be initiated but will not be available for 2012.

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.BAMM chosen (i.e. alternative method).Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes.Planned actions to comply with Subpart W.Documenting volume between isolation valves, temperature at actual conditions, and absolute pressure at actual conditions will be initiated but will not be available for 2012.  In addition, rule revisions and interpretations will be tracked, as it is expected that additional discussions on blowdown vent reporting will occur in 2012 and rule revisions or clarifications "

This portion of fuel consumption was estimated based on an assumption of 98% run-time applied to a fuel consumption rate of the units."
