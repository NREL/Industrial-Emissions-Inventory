# All entries have a type which can be a 'set' or 'filter' and a 'description'
# A 'set' contains a list of 'filters'
# A 'filter' contains an optional list of 'parameters' which can be unique to each filter

remove_duplicate_organic_enrichment:
    type: filter
    description: >
        Removes facility overlap of organic enrichment reporting. Facilities can
        report multiple forms of organic enrichment, BOD and COD, which represent
        duplicate accounting of oxygen depletion. See Meyer et al. 2020
    parameters:
      flow_preference: 'COD'

        associated with the National Biennial Report.
